# TheTypingDetective
A simple typing game created using Javascript, HTML and CSS. Test how fast you can type using some quotes from Sherlock Holmes.

This has been created as part of my learning process. Alongside the code, I have included comments to explain the code, and this can be used for learning/referring to the basics of the languages.
